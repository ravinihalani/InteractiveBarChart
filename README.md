# InteractiveBarChart 

https://ravinihalani.github.io/InteractiveBarChart/coffee-vis/

This is a D3 Javascript implementation of interactive barchart visualization using the csv data of coffee product sales at a fictional company. The visualization shown consists of two drop downs and an update button. Once the user chooses an attribute to show on the x-axis, say profit, and for the y-axis, say region, clicking on the update button shows a barchart with accumulated sum of profits over the different regions.
